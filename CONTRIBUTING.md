   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm start server  # Test the web interface
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features, async/await for promises
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and JuliaOS integrations
- **Error Handling**: Always include proper error handling with fallbacks
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes  
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `test:` - Test improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
node src/tests/agents.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests to `src/tests/` directory
- Use Node.js built-in test runner
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external API calls when appropriate

## üìù Documentation

### Updating Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment changes
- Include examples in documentation

### JuliaOS Integration

When adding JuliaOS features:
- Document the specific APIs used
- Include fallback behavior for when JuliaOS is unavailable
- Add configuration options to `src/config/juliaos.js`
- Test with both live and mock JuliaOS backends
